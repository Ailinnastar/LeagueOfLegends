# Introduction
The datasets taken from all of the professional League of Legends games that have taken place in 2023, consisted with 128,064 rows and 93 columns.

This analysis will investigate about "**If the most banded champion is picked by a team will the team have higher chance to win that game**". 

Often some champions are the top choices in banding, which made me curious about if the champion is picked luckily will those champion increase the chance of winning, as it will carry the game compared to other champions.
